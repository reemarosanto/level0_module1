* 1. Look at the image bananasplit.png

* 2. Your mission is to create a python program that recreates that image
     using the create_text function
     
* 3. The catch is, you can only type the create_text function ONE TIME ONLY
     into your program. Using a loop and if-statements, you must figure out
     how to vary the text and the positioning so that you can read all four
     separate lines.
